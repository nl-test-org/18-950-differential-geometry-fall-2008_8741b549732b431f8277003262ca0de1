Description
-----------

This course is an introduction to differential geometry. Students should have a good knowledge of multivariable calculus and linear algebra, as well as tolerance for a definition–theorem–proof style of exposition. The course itself is mathematically rigorous, but still emphasizes concrete aspects of geometry, centered on the notion of curvature.

Topics
------

*   Local and global geometry of plane curves
*   Local geometry of hypersurfaces
*   Global geometry of hypersurfaces
*   Geometry of lengths and distances

Prerequisites
-------------

Analysis I (18.100) plus Linear Algebra (18.06 or 18.700) or Algebra I (18.701)

The course will follow the first half of Kuhnel, but rather loosely. For that reason, attendance, and taking notes in classes, is strongly encouraged.
